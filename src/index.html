        <span class="sectionTitle">Our Philosophy</span>
        <p class="quote">"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."
          <br/> - Albert Einstein</p>
        <p>We design with a <strong>purpose</strong>. Every element on our designs has a <strong>reason</strong>, to draw your audience in. We don't add bells and whistles just for the sake of having bells and whistles. We don't throw on additions that are more likely to <strong>distract and frustrate</strong> all but the most tech savvy of users.

          <p>We believe in <strong>clean, accessible</strong> design. Results that work equally well on everything from a smartphone to a 4k ultra high-definition monitor. Something that your grandmother on her 10 year old computer can use just as easily as your genius pre-teen cousin on their new MacBook.</p>

          <p>We use a <strong>mobile first</strong> design strategy. We build <strong>responsive websites</strong> that work across all devices. We design websites that your users will <strong>enjoy</strong> using and will want to come back and spend time browsing just for the experience.</p>

          <p>We use the latest <strong>trends and technology</strong> in web design, as long as it doesn't break backwards compatibility with your users.</p>

          <p>Most importantly our end goal is to make you <strong>look good</strong>.</p>

        <p><span class="service">Custom Website ----- <small>from</small> $700</span>
          <br /> We will hand-code you a site from the ground up exactly to your specifications. Need something quick and simple, one or two pages, to let your customers know who you are and what you offer? Or maybe you are after something truly custom and a Content Management System just won't cut it? This is the option for you.</p>

        <p><span class="service">WordPress Site ----- <small>from </small> $900</span>
          <br /> WordPress is by far the most used Content Management System in the world. Not just for blogs anymore, WordPress is a great solution for anyone who needs a website for their small business that they can update on their own without having to know any code. We will set you up with a fresh WordPress install, help you choose and install a template, and give you a crash course on how to maintain and update your new site. We can also design a custom template just for you or code up a custom WordPress plugin to fit your needs.</p>

        <p><span class="service">Personal Webmaster ----- <small>from</small> $150/month</span>
          <br /> So you've got a <strong>beautiful, responsive website</strong>. Now what? Chances are, if you knew the answer to that question you wouldn't have needed to hire us in the first place. Other companies will make you a website, take your money, and then you're <strong>on your own</strong>. Not us. A great website is just the beginning. From <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong> to <strong>Social Media Marketing</strong>, we are here with you for all of your online needs.</p>
        <p>The web is an incredibly fast moving place. A static website is a <strong>dead website</strong>. The most effective websites are ones that are frequently updated and always evolving. But you've got a <strong>business to run</strong>, you don't have time for that. That's why we offer affordable <strong>website maintenance</strong> services. You can have all of the advantages of an on-staff Webmaster at a fraction of the cost.</p>
        <p>Sign up for a 6 month contract and get 10% off the cost of your initial site development! Sign up for a year and get 25% off! </p>

        <p><span class="service">Custom Development ----- <small>starting from</small> $85/hr</span>
          <br /> For anything else you might need. Our shop rates range from $85 to $105 per hour, depending on what other services you already have with us. If it involves the web, chances are we can do it for you for an affordable price.</p>
